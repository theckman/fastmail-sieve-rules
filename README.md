fastmail-sieve-rules
====================

This is just my current Sieve rules file being used by [Fastmail](http://www.fastmail.fm/?STKI=11926421) for email filtering.

I am placing this here mostly for my convenience, but hopefully it may come in handy for some others as a starting point. If you have any questions or feedback feel free to reach out to me at <[t@heckman.io](mailto://t@heckman.io)>.

Installation
------------
The sieve rules are hidden by default within the Fastmail UI. Here are the instructions for being able to work with your account's sieve rules directly. 

**Note:** Once you make changes to your sieve rules file, you can no longer use the UI to generate mail rules. You will need to either revert the sieve rules file, or continue to use sieve.

1. At the top left of the Fastmail mail UI click the down arrow on in the top left corner.
2. Click `Advanced`
3. Once you are in the advanced settings area, fund the `Rules` category
4. Once there, scroll down to the bottom and click `View filter source, click "Apply all changes" to save changes first (advanced users only)`

Once you have finished editing the sieve rules, click `Apply all changes` (right above the text box). You are now using sieve rules!
